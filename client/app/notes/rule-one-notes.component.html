    <h1>The Myths of Investing</h1>
    <blockquote>
        <p>...almost everyone is convinced that a higer rate of return necessarily means a lot more risk. And they're more afraid
            of losing money in an attempt to get a higer return than of their inability to retire comfortably.</p>

        <p>...fund managers are the market; when they move billions of dollars into a stock, the price of that stock goes up.
            When they take their money out, the price of that stock goes down.</p>

    <h1>Rule #1 and the Four Ms</h1>
    <blockquote>
        <p>A Rule #1 investor looks at stocks as businesses that have a determinable value, and then waits patiently for market
            fluctuations to bring her that business at a great price.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Knowing you will make money comes from buying a wonderful business at an attractive price.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>wonderful implies that the business has Meaning to you - that you understand it enough to want to own the whole thing
            if you could, that you'd be proud to own it, and that the business reflects your values.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>wonderful means that the business meets certain criteria in terms of financial strength and predictability; in particular,
            it must have a so-called Moat, And, third, it must have good Management.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>By "attractive" I mean we can buy the business with a very big Margin of Safety (MOS). To me a nice MOS is buying
            a dollar of value for fifty cents. So, once I know what a business is worth, I want to buy it for half that price.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If it's predictable, we can determine a value. If it's not a predictable business, it's impossible to know what it's
            worth.
        </p>

            <li>Repeat until very rich.</li>
        </ol>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The price of a thing is not always equal to its value.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Buying stocks as businesses is just like that, except there is no sticker price on the window. We have to figure
            out what the sticker price is, and then pay less.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>In essence, Rule #1 is just about being a good shopper.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>All it takes is learning how to determine the values of wonderul companies and waiting for the market to sell you
            those companies at discounted prices.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <ol>
            <li>Does the business have Meaning to you? <small>you'd be willing to make this business the solo financial support of you family for the next 100 years?</small></li>
            <li>Does the business have a wide Moat? <small>be able to defend itself against attacks by competitors</small></li>
            <li>Does the business have great Management? <small>people running the business are doing so as if it were their family's only means of support for the next 100 years. ...and not going to rip you off for their short-term benefit</small></li>
            <li>Does the business have a big Margin of Safety? <small>know the value of the business and can get it on sale</small></li>
        </ol>
        <p>

            If you can answer a big unconditional YES to all four of these questions, you'll know if this business is one you want to
            buy.

        <p>sell it later without losing money</p>

    <h1>Buy a Business, Not a Stock</h1>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The First M question - Does the business have Meaning to you? - implies two other questions: (1) Do you want to own
            the whole business? and (2) Do you understand it well enough to own all of it?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If we buy business as a business and not as a stock speculation, then it becomes personal. I want it to be personal.
            I want to be proud of what I own.</p>

        <p>The 10-10 Rule: I won't own this business for ten minutes unless I'm willing to own it for ten years.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>we might buy the business today and sell it in a month and then buy it back three months later and then sell it again
            a few weeks after that. The fact that we buy it as if we're going to keep it for ten years does not preclude
            us from buying and selling this business over and over.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>How crazy would that be? If his one business is too risky, why would diversifying into five more businesses make
            the first one less risky?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>We have the luxury of waiting patiently until we can find wonderful companies at attractive prices...</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>So what kinds of businesses should you own? The ones you understand. Those businesses tend to be about who you are.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Meaning, in the Rule #1 sense, is just about inderstanding what a company does and how it does it - enought to be
            happy to put your name on the business and expect to keep it there for the next hundred yeards or so.</p>

        <p>Draw three circles that intersect in the middle. Label the first circle "Passion". Label the second circle "Talent",
            and label the third circle "Money".</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>As yourself these three questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What do you love to do, professionally and as recreation?</li>
            <li>What things are you really good at?</li>
            <li>What do you do to make money or what do you spend money on?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your answers - especially the ones that recur with respect to all three questions - will help you begin to pick your
            own wonderful companies.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Go online to Yahoo! and click on "Finance", then "Industries", and then "Industry Index". As you'll see, just about
            every business in the world falls into one of these 12 categories or "sectors".</p>
    </blockquote>

        <p>Rule #1 investors don't do anyting they aren't certain about. No gray areas. It's either clear and cetain they understand
            the business, or it isn't.</p>

    <h1>Identify a Moat</h1>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Finding a business with a wide Moat is key to finding a sucessful business to own, because a business with a wide
            Moat is much more predictable for the next 20 years than a business </p>

        <p>durable competitive advantage that protects it from attack, like a moat protects a castle</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If an indeustry looks as if it might be very easey to get into, there probably isn't a Moat. On the other hand, if
            it looks as though i might be really hard to get into and be successful, you'll probably find some wide-Moat
            businesses.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Commodity businesses don't have Moats. If you own a commodity business, you have exactly zero protectionfrom commpetitors.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>What that wide Moat means to a business owner is that the business is very hard to compete against.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>You can't compete with Coke by lowering your price, and that's also a sign of a wide Moat.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>What's even more spectacular about businesses with wide Moats is they can keep u with inflation. In other words,
            they can raise prices as their costs go up.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Wal-Mart ha a Moat based on price. Pfizer gets its Moat from patents on drugs. Intel gets its Moat from its long
            experience in building chips. PG&E protects itself by government law.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>That's the purpose of the Moat around the castle: protection from inflation and competition.</p>

        <p>Rule #1 companies - can do that because they have some kind of monopolistic position in the market.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Moats can be created by trade secrets that keep other businesses from copying them.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>It doesn't have to be a "monopoly" in a classic sense (meaning it has exclusive control over a particular area of
            the market), but is should be a company that is well known for being number one or number two in its industry.</p>

            <li>Tools tell us Wave Runners the direction the cruise ships are turning so we can get ahead of them in their path,

    <h1>The Tree Tools</h1>
    <blockquote>
        <p>...Tools (some refer to them as "technical indicators")...</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>All that's required is that you learn how to translate the signals - to know whether the Tools say "buy" or "sell".</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Sure, your fund manager has these Tools. They were build for him, rembmber? The problem for your fund manager is
            one we've already explored: he's moving so much money around that he is the Tools.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>It's very hard to watch these Tools for signals to get in or get out if you're the one creating the signals!</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The first Tool in our kit is the MACD - moving average convergence divergence.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The MACD is the combination of two moving averages - a fast one and a slow one - and how they interact (how they
            converge and diverge).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Most MACDs use an exponential moving average...These are called EMAs: exponential moving averages.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>What's the significance of the valley beginning to become a mountain...that's the precise point when the big guys
            have been moving so much money into the stock for so long that a significant price move upward is imminent.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Beginning of a mountain, time to buy. Beginning of a valley, time to sell.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>To imitate how I like to view an MACD chart, you need to configure the MACD in a particular way, namely by plugging
            in three specific numbers. ...change the settings from 12-26-9 to 8-17-9.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>We want multiple confirmations that the bug guys are getting in or getting out.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The second Tool in our kit is the Stochastic...This is a momentum tool that tracks the overbuying and overselling
            of a stock. Overselling occurs when a big institutional guy start selling and others join in.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>One of these lines is called the "buy line", and the other is called the "sell line". Buy line crosses up, buy. Buy
            line crosses down, sell.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>...Stochastic is signaling that the stock is going from oversold (too many sellers) to overbought.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The slow Stochastic that I like the best uses two numbers. The first number covers the number of periods, and I use
            14 trading days. The second number creates a moving average to provide a trigger point. I like a five-day moving
            average.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The third Tool that I love to use is called a moving average. Moving averages are simply closing prices over a defined
            number of days divided by that number of days.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The moving average smooths out the peaks and valleys of daily price fluctuations and gives traders an easy view of
            the price trend.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>... kind of floor or ceiling on the price, As the price goes above the moving average, it's breaking throught the
            psychological ceiling by creating a new short-term high price, and that's a signal the attitude toward this stock
            has gotten positive. If it goes the other way, breaking throught the floor, the attitude of the market has turned
            negative.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>I like to use a 10-day moving average because, unlike the MACD and Stochastic, I want this Tool to give me an early
            signal.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>When the price line crosses above the moving average line, buy. When the price line crosses below the moving average
            line, sell.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>When all three Tools are saying "buy", it's time to get in. When all three are saying "sell", it's time to get out.
            (Yes, wait for all three to five the signal.)</p>
