    <h1>Make Money No Matter What</h1>
    <blockquote>
        <p>...15 percent or more in the stock market, with almost no risk.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>striving for a 15-percent return by guessing what to invest in ("speculating" in investor-speak) is a guaranteed
            way to lose money.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>According to Buffett, "There are only two rules of investing: Rule #1: Don't lose money ... and Rule #2: Don't forget
            Rule #1.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>You possess an enormous number of built-in advantages - from what you know and what information you can access, to
            how fast you can move in and out of the market. The totality of these advantages makes it possible to outperform
            the so-called experts.</p>

    <h1>The Myths of Investing</h1>
    <blockquote>
        <p>...almost everyone is convinced that a higer rate of return necessarily means a lot more risk. And they're more afraid
            of losing money in an attempt to get a higer return than of their inability to retire comfortably.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>...almost no fund managers have done what they're paid by you to do - beat the market.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            Myth 1. You Have to Be an Expert to Manage Money.<br> Myth 2. You Can't Beat the Market.<br> Myth 3. The Best
            Way to Minimize Risk Is to Fiversify and Hold for the Long Term).<br>
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>...find a wonderful company at an attractive price...You focus on a few businesses that you understand. You buy when
            the big guys...</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>...fund managers are the market; when they move billions of dollars into a stock, the price of that stock goes up.
            When they take their money out, the price of that stock goes down.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The fund managers control the price of almost all the stocks in the market, but they can't easily get out when they
            want to.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>A Rule #1 business buyers, we pick a few choice businesses in different sectors of the market.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Rule #1 investors know the value of a wonderful business and buy it when it's undervalued.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Buy a dollar for 50 cents, and sell it later for a dollar. Repeat until very rich.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>We buy a wonderful business (actually a part of business via shares of stock) at an attractive price...</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>power of compounding money at 15 percent a year or more depends on not losing it - ever.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If the price of a stock drops 80 percent, it has to go up 400 percent to break even.</p>

    <h1>Rule #1 and the Four Ms</h1>
    <blockquote>
        <p>A Rule #1 investor looks at stocks as businesses that have a determinable value, and then waits patiently for market
            fluctuations to bring her that business at a great price.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Knowing you will make money comes from buying a wonderful business at an attractive price.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>wonderful implies that the business has Meaning to you - that you understand it enough to want to own the whole thing
            if you could, that you'd be proud to own it, and that the business reflects your values.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>wonderful means that the business meets certain criteria in terms of financial strength and predictability; in particular,
            it must have a so-called Moat, And, third, it must have good Management.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>By "attractive" I mean we can buy the business with a very big Margin of Safety (MOS). To me a nice MOS is buying
            a dollar of value for fifty cents. So, once I know what a business is worth, I want to buy it for half that price.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If it's predictable, we can determine a value. If it's not a predictable business, it's impossible to know what it's
            worth.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <ol>
            <li>Find a wonderful business.</li>
            <li>Know what it's worth as a business.</li>
            <li>Buy it at 50 percent off.</li>
            <li>Repeat until very rich.</li>
        </ol>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The price of a thing is not always equal to its value.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Buying stocks as businesses is just like that, except there is no sticker price on the window. We have to figure
            out what the sticker price is, and then pay less.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>In essence, Rule #1 is just about being a good shopper.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>All it takes is learning how to determine the values of wonderul companies and waiting for the market to sell you
            those companies at discounted prices.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The Sticker Price of a business is determined by the kind of surplus cash it can produce for its owners in the future.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>"the Four Ms": Meaning, Moat, Management, and Margin of Safety.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <ol>
            <li>Does the business have Meaning to you? <small>you'd be willing to make this business the solo financial support of you family for the next 100 years?</small></li>
            <li>Does the business have a wide Moat? <small>be able to defend itself against attacks by competitors</small></li>
            <li>Does the business have great Management? <small>people running the business are doing so as if it were their family's only means of support for the next 100 years. ...and not going to rip you off for their short-term benefit</small></li>
            <li>Does the business have a big Margin of Safety? <small>know the value of the business and can get it on sale</small></li>
        </ol>
        <p>

            If you can answer a big unconditional YES to all four of these questions, you'll know if this business is one you want to
            buy.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>sell it later without losing money</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>There are opportunities to buy wonderful companies at attractive prices - they really do exist - if you're willing
            to do your homework and say good-bye to mutual funds.</p>
